# DataX Token Creation Fix

## Problem

DataX was encountering "Too much memory was allocated" (panic code 0x41) errors when attempting to create DataTokens for NFTs. This error occurred in the Solidity smart contract when deploying tokens with certain names and symbols, particularly longer ones.

## Solution

We've created a simplified DataToken contract that uses less memory while maintaining the core functionality needed for dataset tokenization. The solution includes:

1. **Simplified Smart Contract**: A new `SimplifiedDatatoken.sol` contract that:
   - Uses fewer storage variables
   - Simplifies the token creation process
   - Maintains core ERC20 functionality
   - Still links to the DataNFT contract

2. **Two-Step Tokenization Process**:
   - First, deploy the simplified token contract
   - Then link it to the NFT using a separate transaction

3. **Enhanced API Routes**:
   - `/api/simplified-token`: Prepares the transaction for the simplified token deployment
   - `/api/link-token`: Links the newly created token to the NFT

4. **Updated Client Interface**:
   - Modified `clientSigner.ts` to try the simplified approach first
   - Added a dedicated UI page at `/token-fix` for users to easily access this functionality
   - Created a reusable `TokenizeButton` component

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Token Fix Tool" in the dashboard sidebar
2. Enter the NFT ID of the dataset you want to tokenize
3. Click "Tokenize Dataset"
4. The system will:
   - Deploy a simplified token with minimal memory usage
   - Link the token to your NFT
   - Show the token address once completed

## Technical Details

The simplified token implementation:

- Reduces constructor parameters to only name and symbol
- Uses shorter variable names
- Removes complex features not essential to basic token functionality
- Carefully manages memory allocation

## Deployment

This solution has been fully integrated into the DataX platform. To deploy changes to contracts:

1. Navigate to the Contracts directory
2. Compile the contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
3. Run the extraction script: `node scripts/compile-simplified-datatoken.js`

## Future Improvements

- Further optimize the token contract
- Consider migrating all token creation to this simplified approach
- Add more detailed metrics about token usage
