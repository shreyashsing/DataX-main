# Solution for "Transaction Ran Out of Gas" Issues

## Overview of the Problem
The DataX application was encountering "Transaction ran out of gas" errors when deploying smart contracts, particularly when creating DataTokens for NFTs. This was happening because:

1. The gas limits specified in the code were too low for the complex contracts
2. The bytecode provided was truncated, making it impossible to deploy the contract
3. The hardhat node wasn't configured to allow enough gas
4. The TokenFactory contract was failing in some situations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Gas Limits in API Endpoints

All API endpoints involved in blockchain interactions now use much higher gas limits:
- Mint transactions: 8,000,000 (up from 4,000,000)
- Token creation: 10,000,000 (up from 7,000,000)
- Direct token deployment: 9,000,000 (up from 5,000,000)
- Token linking operations: 1,000,000 (up from 300,000-500,000)
- Marketplace listings: 1,000,000 (up from 500,000)

### 2. Complete DataToken Contract Bytecode

We've updated the application to use complete, pre-compiled bytecode for the DataToken contract. This ensures that when direct token deployment is used (instead of TokenFactory), the complete contract is deployed properly.

### 3. Dynamic Gas Estimation

The client-side code now includes dynamic gas estimation before sending transactions, which automatically increases the gas limit if needed based on the actual requirements of the transaction.

### 4. Fallback to Direct Deployment

If TokenFactory verification fails, the application now falls back to direct DataToken deployment, which is more resilient.

### 5. Improved Error Handling

All contract interactions now include comprehensive error handling to provide better feedback when transactions fail.

### 6. DataToken Purchase Workflow for Buyers

We've implemented a complete token purchase workflow for buyers of datasets:

1. When a dataset is published as an NFT, it automatically gets a DataToken created
2. Buyers can purchase these DataTokens directly using the wallet (MetaMask popup)
3. The purchase process is now:
   - User selects a dataset to purchase
   - System checks if the dataset has a linked DataToken
   - User is prompted to buy tokens with their wallet
   - The transaction is verified on-chain
   - Once verified, the user gets access to download the dataset
   - The token balance is recorded in the database for future access checks

This allows for a Web3-native purchasing experience where buyers receive DataTokens in their wallet that represent their ownership rights to the dataset.

## Utility Scripts

Several utility scripts have been created to help manage these issues:

1. **adjust-gas-limits.js**: Automatically adjusts gas limits across all API routes
2. **compile-datatoken.js**: Properly compiles and extracts the bytecode from the Datatoken contract
3. **hardhat-config-recommendation.js**: Generates a recommended Hardhat configuration with higher gas limits
4. **check-contracts.js**: Verifies contracts are deployed correctly with adequate gas

## Testing Changes

To ensure these changes work correctly:

1. Deploy the contracts with proper gas limits
2. Publish a dataset as an NFT
3. Verify the DataToken is created correctly
4. Test purchasing a token from a different wallet
5. Confirm the purchase transaction succeeds
6. Verify access to the dataset is granted after purchase

If you continue to encounter "Transaction ran out of gas" errors, you can further increase the gas limits in the respective API routes or update your Hardhat configuration based on the provided recommendations.
